# SIMONLANG

Hi my name is `SIMON` and this is a language I'm developing for fun. Have a look at the [playground]

# Extensions

- If you are using vscode you can install the language support plugin on the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rothert.simonlang).

# Installation
    npm i [-g|-D|-S] @puresamari/simonlang

# Usage
## Compiling in js
Since the compiler is written in typescript I compiled a version you can use directly in js (as done in the [playground]) like this:

    <script src="{{path to node_modules}}/lib/simonlang.js" defer></script>
or

    <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puresamari/simon/master/lib/simonlang.js" defer></script>

to compile in js just use `window.compile({{your code}})` after the above script is imported.

# CLI

Once the `simonlang` cli is installed you can use the cli.

## Compiling
to install the cli globally use

    npm i -g @puresamari/simonlang

once it is installed you can use it to complie `.simon` files

    simonlang [compile] FILENAME [-p, --print] [-o, --output OUTPUT_FILENAME] 
To compile `.simon` files into `.js` just run the `compile`. Writing `compile` is optional since its the clis default command.
- `$ simonlang compile test.simon`
- `$ simonlang example/throw-error.simon`

### Options

- `[-o, --output OUTPUT_FILENAME]` Path to write the compiled js file
  - `$ simonlang example/throw-error.simon -o dist/throw-error.js`
  - `$ simonlang index.simon --output dist/index.js`
- `[-p, --print]` Print the compiled contents to the console (for testing)
  - `$ simonlang example/throw-error.simon -p`
  - `$ simonlang example/throw-error.simon -p -o dist/throw-error.js`

Thanks for stopping by and have a great day

# Language
Each line is declared with `simon` (the `simon indicator`) in the beginning. For example `simon says ...` or `simon declares ...`
## Declarations

### Primitive variables
- `Numbers` are written like in JS
- `Booleans` are written by `yes` and `no` or `true` and `false`
- `Strings` are written by just writing text like `Simon is great` === "Simon is great".

A declaration is done by writing "`declares`" after the simon indicator and the variable name after (can be multiple words). After the variable name you can either write "`is`" or "`are`" for better semantics followed by the assigned value.

For example:
- `simon declares simons skill is 100` (var simons_skill = 100)
- `simon declares simons cant do it is no` (var simons_skill = 100)
- `simon declares peanut butter sandwiches are great` (var peanut_butter_sandwiches = "great")

## Operators

### Mathematic operators
You can do mathematics in Simonlang _(currently only while doing declarations)_
#### Usage
To use mathematical operators just write chain as many of the below operators together. For example:

from:

    simon declares variable with simple division is test variable divided by 10
to:

    var simonvar_variable_with_simple_division = simonvar_test_variable / 10;

from

    simon declares chained mathematical operators is 10 minus 10 plus 10 divided by variables are gr8 multiplied by test variable

to:

    var simonvar_chained_mathematical_operators = 10 - 10 + 10 / simonvar_variables_are_gr8 * simonvar_test_variable;

#### Available mathematic operators:
- `minus` becomes `-`
- `plus` becomes `+`
- `divided by` becomes `/`
- `multiplied by` becomes `*`

## Commands
### Printing is done by writing "`says`" after the simon indicator
  - Example with primitive string: `simon says hello world` (console.log("hello world"))
  - Example with before mentioned variable "`simons skill`": `simon says simons skill` (console.log(simons_skill))
  - 
### Mathematic commands (THIS IS STUPID AND WILL BE REMOVED)
- Mathematic operators are written by writing the mathematical operation after the `simon indicator` and seperate two members bye one of the seperators. They re essentially useless right now.
#### Examples
  - `simon adds 15 to test variable` becomes `simonvar_test_variable + 15`
  - `simon multiplies test variable with 4` becomes `simonvar_test_variable * 4`
  - `simon divides test variable by 4` becomes `simonvar_test_variable / 4`
  - `simon subtracts test variable from 4` becomes `4 - simonvar_test_variable;`
#### Mathematical operation keywords:
  - `adds`
  - `multiplies`
  - `divides`
  - `subtracts`
#### Seperators:
- Left hand seperators the trailing member of the operation becomes the leading member in js:
  - to: `simon adds 15 to test variable` becomes `simonvar_test_variable + 15;`
  - from: `simon subtracts test variable from 4` becomes `4 - simonvar_test_variable;`
- Rigth hand seperators the order stays the same:
  - by: `simon multiplies test variable with 4` becomes `simonvar_test_variable * 4;`
  - with: `simon divides test variable by 4` becomes `simonvar_test_variable / 4;`
